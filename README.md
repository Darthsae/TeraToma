# Tera Toma

## Overview

This is basically just a free, open source Demon Bluff like game written in C++. Except this is cooler, because it supports mods.

## Modding

* Look at TeraTomaBaseGame for an example of this. 
* If you make a mod and would like to suggest it be added to the base game, then do that.

## Who Can Make Changes?

Anyone, I might not accept all of them, but you can always fork and maintain a parallel fork if you wish. Seriously, feel free to suggest stuff, or if you can, try to add stuff.
